# Introduction to CUDA (1)

The aim of this project is to understand the basics of CUDA.
While this project focus on the very basis, [this one](https://github.com/Sn0wFox/INSA-5IF-CUDA2) focus on the usage of patterns.

The project is available on [the associated GitHub repository](https://github.com/EspeuteClement/INSA-5IF-CUDA),
and you can get it with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/EspeuteClement/INSA-5IF-CUDA.git
```

## Prerequisites

At the moment, this project **only works on windows using Visual Studio (2017) and Cuda (9.0)**.
We're not planning to support anything else.

## Run the project

Simply clone it and open the .sln with Visual Studio. You will find three projects:
1. In the folder `1`, you will find the code related to the first exercise, i.e. a simple sum of two vectors.
2. In the folder `2`, you will find the code related to the second exercise, i.e. the transformation of a colored pictures into a gray-scaled picture.
3. In the folder `3`, you will find the code related to the third exercise, i.e. the blurring of picture.

NOTE: unfortunately, we had no time to complete the last two exercises related to matrices products,
but we understand the idea behind it.
